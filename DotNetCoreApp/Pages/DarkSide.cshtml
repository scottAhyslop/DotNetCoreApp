                    Once Anakin's fall to Darth Vader had been complete,  he went from place to place, enforcing Darth Sidious' evil Sith will.  He continued to hunt the Jedi down wherever found.  Darth Vader continued to blame the Jedi for Padm&eacute;'s death.

                <p>
                   Darth Vader created the evil Inquisitors who quickly expanded the hunt for the remaining Jedi.  They were Dark Force users themselves, recruited by the Emperor personally and taught arts forbidden even to the Sith.

                    The Resistance began almost immediately after the Empire cam to power and began to push its will onto the people.  The Clone Troopers had been gradually replaced by Stormtroopers, an equally formidable foe.  The machines of war the Republic had built to fight the Separatists were now employed against the free peoples of the galaxy.

                    Darth Vader did many evil and twisted things during these dark decades, but perhaps his greatest challenge was the one from his past.  Battling with some Light Side Jedi at a forbidden Sith Temple, Darth Vader came face to face with his old Padawan, Asoka, who recently joined the nascent Rebellion.  Back and forth the battle raged until at last they both limped away, badly hurt, Vader's iron lung wheezing with his breath in and out.
